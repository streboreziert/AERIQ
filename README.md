##FUNCTIONAL
	•	Measure and register CO₂, humidity, temperature, and pressure
	•	Store and transmit data to a local server or connected device
	•	Display the most recent data on the device display

##NON-FUNCTIONAL
	•	Achieve full functionality on a single battery for 2 months
	•	Sensor accuracy should be within ±40 ppm for CO₂ and ±0.5°C for temperature
	•	Device should maintain at least 95% connection reliability
