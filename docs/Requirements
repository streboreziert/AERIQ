# AERIQ – System Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR1 – Environmental Data Acquisition
The device shall periodically read data from integrated sensors (e.g., CO₂, temperature, humidity, pressure, optional VOC/PM) and timestamp each measurement.

### FR2 – Real-Time Display & Alerts
The system shall display current environmental readings in the user interface (device display and/or web/mobile UI).
The system shall generate a visual alert when predefined threshold values are exceeded (e.g., CO₂ > 1200 ppm).

### FR3 – Data Storage & Transmission
The system shall store measurement history locally and transmit data to a gateway/server (e.g., via MQTT or REST API).
The system shall allow users to view historical data (day/week/month) and export data in CSV format.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1 – Accuracy & Stability
The system shall provide stable sensor readings with minimal drift.
The system shall support calibration mechanisms (e.g., ABC or manual calibration).

### NFR2 – Reliability & Data Integrity
The system shall continue operating without internet connectivity.
The system shall buffer data locally and automatically synchronize once connectivity is restored.

### NFR3 – Performance & Efficiency
The user interface shall update within 1 second of new measurement availability.
The system shall operate in an energy-efficient manner (e.g., optimized sampling interval, sleep modes).
