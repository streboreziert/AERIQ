# Product Delivery & Customer Access

The product is delivered as a **ready-to-use sensing system** that provides data access without requiring technical setup from the customer.

Each sensor node is preconfigured to automatically operate in the best available mode and always expose a **customer-accessible interface**.

## Customer Access to Data

### Normal operation (local network available)
- The product connects to the customer’s **local Wi-Fi network**.
- The customer opens a browser and enters a **known address** (static IP or hostname).
- A **custom HTML page** displays:
  - current measurements  
  - recent and past stored data  
  - device status  

No software installation is required — access is fully browser-based.

### Offline / out-of-range operation
If the local Wi-Fi network is unavailable, the product still guarantees data access:

- **Built-in e-ink display** shows essential information directly on the device.
- The device can create its own **Wi-Fi hotspot**.
  - The customer connects to the hotspot.
  - The same custom HTML page opens in the browser.
  - Past data stored on the device remains accessible.

This ensures the customer can always read data, even without infrastructure.

## Multi-Device Product Delivery (Base Station)

For customers using **multiple sensor nodes**, a base station is included:

- The base station automatically collects data from all delivered nodes.
- It stores and organizes historical records from all devices.
- Customers access a **single central HTML page** to:
  - view all nodes
  - browse past events
  - compare data over time

The base station can operate on:
- the customer’s local network, or
- its own self-created hotspot if no network is available.

## Future Customer App

A future mobile app will:
- directly connect to the same web interface (static IP / hostname),
- provide easier navigation while keeping the system browser-compatible.

No redesign of the product delivery is required for app support.
